## 🔍 Overview

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting communication, behavior, and social interaction. Early detection is critical for effective intervention.

This project provides a **technology-assisted, continuous monitoring system** using wearable sensors and machine learning to identify **early indicators of autism**, helping parents, caretakers, and healthcare professionals take timely action.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Autism diagnosis today is largely based on:
- Behavioral observation
- Clinical questionnaires
- Expert evaluation

Challenges:
- Diagnosis often happens **after the age of 4–5**
- High **subjectivity**
- Limited access to specialists
- No continuous monitoring mechanism

According to trusted studies:
- **1 in 36 children** is diagnosed with ASD globally
- Early intervention can improve outcomes by **40–60%**

There is a strong need for an **objective, data-driven, and scalable solution**.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

- Rising global autism prevalence
- Lack of affordable early screening tools
- Need for continuous behavioral monitoring
- Integration of AI in healthcare diagnostics
- Assist doctors with data-backed insights
