## ❗ Problem Statement

Autism diagnosis today is largely based on:
- Behavioral observation
- Clinical questionnaires
- Expert evaluation

Challenges:
- Diagnosis often happens **after the age of 4–5**
- High **subjectivity**
- Limited access to specialists
- No continuous monitoring mechanism

According to trusted studies:
- **1 in 36 children** is diagnosed with ASD globally
- Early intervention can improve outcomes by **40–60%**

There is a strong need for an **objective, data-driven, and scalable solution**.
